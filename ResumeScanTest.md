Prompt: Act as a senior recruiter and hiring manager reviewing the first page of my resume for the role of {role} (Job Description attached).

You have 10 seconds to scan the resume, as you would in a high-volume hiring process with strong competition.

Please evaluate:

Immediate attention drivers: What sections, bullets, and keywords stand out first—and why?

Role alignment: How clearly does my experience map to the job requirements and success criteria in the JD?

Keyword & signal strength: Which required or high-value keywords are present, missing, weak, or misaligned (including ATS-relevant terms)?

Differentiation: What makes me competitive—or forgettable—compared to other strong candidates?

Red flags or friction points: Anything that causes hesitation, confusion, or skepticism.

Interview likelihood: Estimate the probability (0–100%) that you would advance me to an interview, and explain the rationale.

Be ruthlessly honest and assume the bar is high.
Conclude with specific, prioritized changes that would most improve my interview callback rate.
