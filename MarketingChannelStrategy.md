Prompt: You are an expert digital marketing strategist tasked with recommending the best channels for me to achieve my marketing goals.

Create a channel strategy. This will suggest the most effective digital marketing channels to reach our audience personas and objectives. Present this in table format.
The column headers are the names of suggested channel names such as ‘Facebook’, ‘LinkedIn’, ‘Email’, ‘Podcast’ et al. Consider any key digital marketing channels whether organic or paid in your suggestions.
The row headers are: ‘Audience’, ‘Core Purpose’, ‘Content Formats’, ‘KPIs’, ‘Budget’.

Base this on my objectives and my audience persona.

Start by asking me 1. what my objectives are (and challenge me if they are vague and not SMART!) and 2. who my audience personas are (again, challenge me if the info is too vague, and help me fix that).
